## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, visualizations will be made to describe the data in a presentation format.

## Results
- Majority of Trips are under an hour and usually less than 20 minutes
- Most trips during the weekday are between travel times to and from work
- More Men ride the bikes during the week and during travel times to and from work
- 1,530,272 users are male
- 588,434 users are female
- 225,521 users are of an unkown gender

## Summary
The visualizations give a better idea to the company of the peak hours bikes are used and whom they are used by. This data could give the company a better idea of the areas they need to improve their marketing in or their target audience. Other visualizations that could be made are graphs are starting and ending locations to get a better idea of the most used regions. Another visualization that could be made is bike usage during different weather trends to see when bikes are most being used.
